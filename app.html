        <h2>Purpose and Focus</h2>
        <p>
          Mammopath was created to support people affected by breast cancer—both patients and healthcare providers.
          We understand that breast cancer treatment is not one-size-fits-all. Each person’s experience is unique, and
          treatments can affect individuals differently. Our goal is to help everyone involved by offering tools to
          better track symptoms, understand side effects, and guide treatment decisions with clarity. Mammopath is
          about creating a more informed, personalized, and caring experience.

        <h2>Who Is It For?</h2>
        <p>
          Mammopath is designed for two main groups of people. First, it’s for those who want to reduce their risk of
          developing breast cancer. We provide guidance, resources, and tools to help them stay proactive. Second, it’s
          for individuals who are currently going through breast cancer treatment. For them, Mammopath offers support
          to log symptoms, track medications, manage emotions, and communicate more clearly with their doctors and
          caregivers.

        <h2>How It Works</h2>
        <p>
          Mammopath has two sides: one for patients and one for healthcare providers. As a patient, you can easily log
          how you’re feeling each day, keep track of medications or treatments, and get helpful suggestions along the
          way. If you’re a doctor or nurse, Mammopath helps you see a bigger picture of how your patients are doing
          over time. This makes it easier to catch problems early and adjust care as needed—making treatment safer and
          more effective.

        <h2>Smart Technology That Cares</h2>
        <p>
          Behind the scenes, Mammopath uses artificial intelligence (AI) to make things even easier. For example, it can
          recognize patterns in your symptoms, give early warnings if things seem to be getting worse, and even help you
          write messages to your care team. This smart technology doesn’t replace your doctor—it works alongside them
          to make sure you get the best care, based on your unique needs.

        <h2>Why Mammopath Matters</h2>

          provider trying to make better decisions, this platform is here to support you. It brings clarity to complexity
