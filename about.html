    <p><strong>Mammopath</strong> was founded with a single vision: to revolutionize breast cancer treatment through AI and data-driven support. Our tools are designed to bring clarity and support during one of life’s most difficult journeys.</p>

    <p>We bring together doctors, engineers, and patients to build intelligent digital tools that empower care, improve outcomes, and reduce the burden of side effects. Every interaction with Mammopath is rooted in empathy, research, and the goal of making treatment more personalized.</p>

    <p>Our team believes that technology should be a partner in healing—not a barrier. That’s why we focus on making our platform easy to use, insightful, and meaningful for every patient and provider. Whether you're tracking symptoms or reviewing patient trends, Mammopath helps you make informed decisions faster.</p>

    <p>We're not just building an app—we’re building a future where patients feel heard, providers feel empowered, and care becomes a shared journey guided by real-time insights and trust.</p>
